# Trawler - Bulk download of datasheets

Trawler is an application to help in the facilitation of bulk downloads for datasheets and resources from vendor websites.

This comes about because vendors don't tend to host bulk downloads of their content, or something nice like an rsync mirror, rather we need to result to scraping.

Trawler is built around selenium, which allows us to pretend to be a user and let AJAX and other bits of JavaSctript run to allow us to interact with the vendor website and collect the datasheets.

## Installing

It's still a massive work in progess, so there are no install / usage instructions, but it's not too hard to figure out.
